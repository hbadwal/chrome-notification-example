# chrome-notification-example
- This just works with chrome as if now.
- Integrated this feature with Realtime Cloud Messaging Pub/Sub service too
- Chrome should have asked if you allow notifications from this app or not. If you accepted you are already subscribed to your own private channel to receive notifications. You can see the random name assigned to your private channel. I can add this channel in my realtime messaging account and can send you messages and notifications from there.
- You can send yourself a push notification by either clicking the button or copying the curl command which comes on the app sceen and paste the command in your terminal window.
